I want to build a catholic confession app similar to one of the app which I have in appstore 
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=catholic.confessionguide&hl=en_GB

The app should have the following features:
1. A guide explaining churchs teaching on confession
2. Excerpts from the Catechism of the Catholic Church and other liturgical books
3. FAQ on confession
4. Prayer for confession

Conscience examine screen which takes user to a guided examination of conscience
based on 10 commandments and 7 capital sins and percepts of the catholic church

I have the contents for this in an excel file

Add option to use custom notes if there are any additonal sins.

Apps should be in english. But planning to expand to other languages keep this in mind

App should be very simple and easy to use and user shold feel personal.

I want to build in flutter

Storage either use drift with encryption or any better option if available.

UI also should support multiple languages

This should be the best app available for confession

Should support dark mode
